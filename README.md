# Hydrogen Energy

This repo contains the slides for a short presentation I gave on a possible future with hydrogen energy.

## Build it
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `talk.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukasPietzschmann/hydrogen-energy/build/talk.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/hydrogen-energy/blob/build/talk.pdf).
